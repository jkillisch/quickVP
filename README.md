# quickVP

Automatically batch generate confirmations of participation to give credit to study participants. The output document is tailored to giving credit at my local university. Feel free to adjust the code for your own purposes. To add to the template, simply modify the file /inst/confirmation_template.Rmd. You can pass data to the RMarkdown template via the params object that is created in the function quickVP.

The package requires that LaTex can be rendered by knitr + RMarkdown on your local machine.

Install the package using devtools:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("jkillisch/quickVP")
```

To batch generate multiple confirmations of participation, a data.frame or tibble of student information must be created. Each row corresponds to a student:

```{r}
# Dataframe of participant information
dat <- dplyr::tibble(
  doc_id = c(102, 103, 104),
  student_id = c(132, 234, 421),
  mail = c("student_1@tok.com", "student_2@tok.com", "student_3@tok.com"),
  date = c("23.10.2024", "01.04.2024", "03.09.2024")
)
```

Additionally, global information about the study must be passed to the function quickVP:

```{r}
# The confirmations will be created here:
path <- getwd()

# The title of your study
study_name <- "A Very Important Study"

# The mail adress of the investigator
study_mail <- "investigator@tok.com"

# Up to 10 adress lines of the investigator
study_adress = c(
    "Investigator Name",
    "Street 8",
    "Building B",
    "Room: 1",
    "123456 PLZ"
  )

# The number of VP-hours that should be awarded to the participant
vp_hours <- 1

# This function will write the confirmations to your harddrive
quickVP(
  dat = dat,
  path = path,
  study_name = study_name,
  study_mail = study_mail,
  study_adress = study_adress,
  vp_hours = vp_hours
)
```
