\details{
doc_id is a numeric id that is unique to the confirmation. The id is a
light protection against forgery.

student_id is numeric id unique to the student. This could, for instance, be
a matriculation number.

mail is a character that contains a mail adress of the participant.

date is a character that gives the data of participation.

You may set values of these columns to NA. Then, the respective section of
the confirmation will be skipped.
